To compile you need:
- GNU C compiler and linker
- SDL2 (http://www.libsdl.org) library installed

To build look into Makefile and make adjustments,
then issue "make" (or "gmake").

The binary files are in the subdirectory bin, so
you should be able to run e.g. the Colour Genie
with "bin/cgenie".

The option -h gives a short help.

The resource files are in subdirectories trs80 and cgenie.

Files in ./trs80:
	+ trs80.rom		12K BASIC ROM
	+ trs80.chr		1K character generator
	Files in ./trs80/cas
		+ file.cas	cassette image file
		...
	Files in ./trs80/fd
		+ fd0.img	first floppy image (NEWDOS-80)
		+ fd1.img	second floppy image

Files in ./cgenie:
	+ cgenie.rom		16K BASIC ROM
	+ cgenie.chr		2K character generator
	+ cgdos.rom		8K DOS extension ROM
	+ cgenie.def		disassembler (dz80) control file
	Files in ./cgenie/cas
		+ file.cas	cassette image file
		...
	Files in ./cgenie/fd
		+ fd0.img	first floppy image
		+ fd1.img	second floppy image
		...
